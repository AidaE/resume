# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This resume application implements comprehensive user data isolation to ensure that each user can only access their own details and resumes. The security is implemented at multiple layers using Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) and proper authentication checks.

## Security Layers

### 1. Authentication Layer
- **Supabase Auth**: All users must authenticate before accessing any data
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling with proper sign-out functionality
- **User Validation**: Every data operation validates user authentication first

### 2. Database Security (Row Level Security)
All tables have RLS enabled with user-specific policies:

#### Candidates Table
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own candidate data"
  ON candidates
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Related Tables (Experiences, Skills, Education, etc.)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage own experiences"
  ON experiences
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    candidate_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM candidates WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### 3. Application Layer Security

#### ResumeService Security Features
- **User Validation**: `validateUser()` method ensures authentication before any operation
- **Candidate Isolation**: `ensureCandidate()` method creates/retrieves user-specific candidate records
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Uses upsert operations to prevent duplicate candidate creation
- **Cache Management**: Clears cached data on sign-out to prevent data leakage

#### Data Access Patterns
- All data queries are filtered by `candidate_id` which is linked to the authenticated user
- No direct user ID exposure in client-side code
- Proper error handling for authentication failures

## Security Features Implemented

### âœ… Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enabled on all tables: `candidates`, `experiences`, `skills`, `education`, `certifications`, `languages`, `tailored_resumes`
- User-specific policies ensure data isolation
- Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity

### âœ… Authentication Requirements
- All data operations require valid user session
- Automatic redirect to auth on authentication failure
- Proper session cleanup on sign-out

### âœ… User Data Isolation
- Each user has their own `candidate` record
- All related data (experiences, skills, etc.) linked via `candidate_id`
- No cross-user data access possible

### âœ… Error Handling
- Graceful handling of authentication errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic sign-out on authentication failures

### âœ… Cache Management
- Clears cached candidate ID on sign-out
- Prevents data leakage between user sessions
- Resets application state on authentication change

### âœ… Race Condition Prevention
- Uses upsert operations for candidate creation
- Prevents duplicate candidate records
- Handles concurrent user registration

## Database Schema Security

### Foreign Key Relationships
```sql
-- All tables reference candidates table
candidate_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES candidates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

-- Candidates table references auth.users
user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

### Indexes for Performance
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_candidates_user_id ON candidates(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_experiences_candidate_id ON experiences(candidate_id);
-- ... similar indexes for all related tables
```

## Testing Security

The application includes a built-in security test component that verifies:

1. **Authentication Requirements**: Ensures data access requires authentication
2. **User Data Isolation**: Verifies users can only access their own data
3. **RLS Policy Enforcement**: Tests that Row Level Security is working correctly

To run security tests:
1. Navigate to the home screen
2. Click the "Security Test" button
3. Review the test results

## Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to their own data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (auth, RLS, application)
3. **Secure by Default**: All tables have RLS enabled
4. **Input Validation**: Proper data validation and sanitization
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
6. **Session Management**: Proper session cleanup and cache clearing

## Potential Security Considerations

### Current Implementation Strengths
- âœ… Comprehensive RLS policies
- âœ… Proper authentication checks
- âœ… User data isolation
- âœ… Secure error handling
- âœ… Cache management

### Future Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Rate limiting for API calls
- ðŸ”„ Audit logging for data access
- ðŸ”„ Two-factor authentication support
- ðŸ”„ Data encryption at rest
- ðŸ”„ API key rotation

## Monitoring and Logging

The application includes debug logging for security-related operations:
- Authentication attempts
- Data access patterns
- Error conditions
- Cache operations

## Compliance

This implementation follows security best practices for:
- **Data Privacy**: User data is completely isolated
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with user-specific permissions
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation
- **Session Security**: Proper session management and cleanup

## Conclusion

The resume application implements robust security measures to ensure complete user data isolation. Each user can only access their own details and resumes, with multiple layers of protection including authentication, Row Level Security, and application-level validation.
